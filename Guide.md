<h1 align="center">Steps to post your solutions</h1>

### In order to sumbit the solution to the respective questions, you need to follow the following steps.

1. Firstly, you need to fork the repository **Competitive-Programming-and-DSA**.
2. Every week we'll be posting 6-7 questions inside the **/Questions** folder inside the **questions.md** file.
   These questions will be classified into different levels of difficulties.
3. In order to submit the solution to the respective questions, you need to create a file for that particular question inside the **/solutions** folder. Say, you want to post the solution to question 1 in java, create a file named **solution_1.java**. The naming convention is **solution_number.(your_language)** . Obviously, you can write in the programming language of your choice.
4. Now, since you have done your changes, next step would be to commit them.
4. Lastly, you have to create a pull request. Keep base repo as the CODE++ original repo and the head repo as your forked one. Give a suitable name to the PR. Finally click on Create Pull Request.
5. The solution with the best time and space complexity will be merged into the original repository.


**Important** - Every now and then, usually before creating a pull request to post your solutions, please create a reverse pull request(i,e, keep base repo as your forked one and the head repo as the CODE++ original repo) so that your forked repo gets updated wrt original repo. Or, you can simply click on Fetch upstream in your forked repo.

**Note** - We encourage you to explain your code also in your words so that it'll be easy for others to understand.
